Wireframe Article Response

The first thing the author of the article mentioned was to clarify what the problem was. I did not previously think of creating a website or wireframe as solving a problem. The questions the author proposed were valid because when you’re creating anything, whether it is a wireframe or a physical product, the aim is to appeal to some audience that has a problem and to help them. Creating a wireframe is often solving the problem of accessibility - you want to make the user’s experience as easy and straightforward for them as possible. 
The author also talked about the importance of sketching and feedback. This makes sense since the wireframe is the foundation and without a good foundation, there can be no good website or program. I agree that getting feedback is important because you don’t want to get halfway through a project that you have put a lot of time into only for someone to tell you that they’re unhappy or that they want to go in a different direction. It is better to be open with and communicate with the people you work with. 
The article reiterated to me the importance of becoming an expert in what you are doing, particularly with the tools you may need. A new project can take three times as long if you are not familiar with what you are working with because getting to know a program or tool takes time to become accustomed to. Additionally, I think her last point about knowing your audience can be applied not only to who you are working with, but also to how you make the wireframe. The audience of the final product should be considered when you are making the wireframe.
